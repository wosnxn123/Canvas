/**
 * Lophinya: run a rejected sync Bukkit scheduler task on the context the caller was already on.
 *
 * <h2>The gap</h2>
 * Paper's {@code scheduleSyncDelayedTask} / {@code runTaskLater} means "run this on the main thread,
 * {@code delay} ticks from now". Folia has no main thread, so it rejects the call outright - and
 * because plugins schedule these from inside event handlers, the rejection propagates out of the
 * handler and kills whatever the plugin was doing. Measured example: GriefPrevention's claim
 * boundary visualization schedules a one-tick task to undo its fake blocks, so the rejection escapes
 * {@code PlayerEventHandler.onPlayerInteract} and the golden-shovel interaction never completes -
 * no visualization, and the rest of the handler's bookkeeping is skipped too.
 *
 * <h2>Why "the caller's own context" is not a guess</h2>
 * {@code DEC-19} B1 forbids inferring a region owner from a contextless {@link Runnable}, and that
 * prohibition is right: nothing about a bare {@code Runnable} says which region may touch what.
 * This class does not look at the runnable. It looks at <b>which thread asked</b>, which Folia
 * already knows the answer for:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The caller is ticking a region ⇒ the task goes to that region. Paper's promise was "the
 *       thread you are on, later"; on Folia the nearest true statement of that is "the region you
 *       are on, later".</li>
 *   <li>The caller is the global region (plugin {@code onEnable}, console command, global tick) ⇒
 *       the task goes to the global region, for the same reason.</li>
 *   <li>The caller is neither - an async thread, or a thread with no owning context ⇒ <b>nothing is
 *       inferred and the call is rejected exactly as on stock Folia</b>, with the existing
 *       diagnostics. This is the case B1 is about, and it stays closed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This is also not the "route any rejected sync task to GlobalRegionScheduler" shim that
 * {@code DEC-05} / {@code N13} rejected on measured grounds. That proposal sent tasks to the global
 * region <i>regardless of where they came from</i>, which relocates a region-scoped task onto a
 * thread that owns nothing. Here the global region is used only when the global region is what
 * asked, so no task ever changes context.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is safe, and what it does not promise</h2>
 * Redispatching cannot make an unsafe task safe, and does not try to. A task that reaches across
 * into another region's world state still hits {@code TickThread.ensureTickThread} and still fails,
 * loudly, at the actual access - with the plugin, the jar and the callsite named. Nothing is
 * swallowed and no check is weakened. What changes is that a task which was <i>never given a chance
 * to run</i> now runs, and only genuinely cross-region work fails - which is the project's model:
 * load it, let it fail at the real callsite, and make that callsite the next thing worth fixing.
 *
 * <p>Region merge and split are handled by the platform, not here: the task is scheduled through
 * {@link org.bukkit.Bukkit#getRegionScheduler()}, whose backing store is regionised data with
 * merge/split callbacks, and whose owner is resolved from the chunk key at execution time rather
 * than captured now.
 *
 * <h2>Relationship to the researched rule table</h2>
 * {@link LophinyaPluginSchedulerDispatch} runs first and still wins when it has an entry, because a
 * researched rule can be <i>more precise</i> than the caller's context - a task known to belong to
 * one player goes to that player's own {@code EntityScheduler}, which keeps working when the player
 * moves between regions, and a task known to belong to one chunk goes to that chunk's region even
 * when it was scheduled from somewhere else. This class is the general case underneath: it needs no
 * per-plugin entry, no jar hash, and no core release to cover a plugin nobody has looked at yet.
 * The rule table is therefore temporary compatibility data, not the mechanism.
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code -Dlophinya.compat.callerContextDispatch=false} restores stock Folia
 * rejection for everything this class would have redispatched.
