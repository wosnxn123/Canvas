/**
 * Lophinya: generic, table-driven scheduler redispatch for plugins whose {@code onEnable()} (or
 * later runtime behavior) is blocked by a sync scheduler call Folia rejects outright.
 *
 * <h2>What this is, precisely</h2>
 * A registry of {@link Rule}s, keyed by the exact SHA-256 of one plugin jar. Each rule says
 * "when THIS task class is about to be rejected, dispatch it THIS way instead" - where the class is
 * either named, or (for the lambdas and method references modern plugins schedule) identified by the
 * one class that declared it, see {@link #matches(Rule, String)} - either to
 * {@link io.papermc.paper.threadedregions.scheduler.GlobalRegionScheduler} (for tasks with no
 * single player/location context) or to a specific player's own
 * {@link io.papermc.paper.threadedregions.scheduler.EntityScheduler} (read via reflection on a
 * named field, for tasks scoped to exactly one known player).
 *
 * <h2>What this is <b>not</b></h2>
 * This is <b>not</b> a general "route any rejected sync task to GlobalRegionScheduler" shim - that
 * idea was tested and rejected (project-docs {@code CORE_COMPAT_INVESTIGATION.md}, {@code DEC-05}'s
 * S-3): a bytecode scan of all 35 s01 plugins found it would fully unlock exactly one of them,
 * because almost every plugin's sync scheduler calls are a mix of genuinely-global tasks and
 * tasks that implicitly assume they're running on a specific region's thread. Blindly relocating
 * the second kind doesn't make it safe - it either still fails somewhere inside, or worse, silently
 * touches state from the wrong thread if some code path doesn't hit an explicit ownership check.
 * <p>
 * What actually distinguishes a safe rule from an unsafe guess is that <b>a human (or an agent,
 * under the same evidentiary bar) read the real source of that exact class</b> and confirmed it
 * has no such implicit assumption - see the evidence file cited next to each entry in
 * {@link #RULES}. Adding a plugin here without that research is exactly the mistake this design
 * exists to prevent; the table only makes the <i>mechanical</i> part (wiring a verified rule into
 * the scheduler) cheap to repeat, not the verification itself.
 * <p>
 * Every rule is also version-locked to one exact jar SHA-256 - a plugin update requires a new
 * entry with fresh research, never inherits the previous version's rules.
 *
 * <h2>Fail-closed by construction</h2>
 * Any reflection failure (a field renamed/removed upstream) makes {@link #tryDispatch} return
 * {@code null} - the call falls through to stock Folia rejection, exactly as if no rule existed.
 * This class never guesses; an unreadable field means "unknown," not "assume the safe case."
 *
 * <h2>Cleanup on plugin disable</h2>
 * Every task this class successfully reschedules is tracked per-plugin and cancelled by
 * {@link #cancelAll(Plugin)}, called from the same plugin-disable hook patch 0024 added for the
 * restored async scheduler - otherwise a disabled plugin's redispatched tasks would keep running
 * forever, the same bug class that hardening round fixed for async tasks ({@code DEC-17}).
 *
 * <p>Kill switch: {@code -Dlophinya.compat.pluginSchedulerDispatch=true} - defaults to
 * <b>off</b>. This mechanism reflects into third-party plugin internals; it should never be a
 * silent default.

     * <p>Named task classes are matched exactly, as before. Lambdas and method references have no
     * source-level name to match: the JVM synthesises one per call site, as
     * {@code <declaringClass>$$Lambda/0x<address>} (JDK 15 and later) or
     * {@code <declaringClass>$$Lambda$<n>} (older). The address part is a different value on every
     * run, so an exact rule can never match one - which is why the rule table could only ever
     * express plugins written in the older named-{@code Runnable} style.
     *
     * <p>What makes the prefix usable as a rule key rather than a wildcard is that
     * <b>the part before {@code $$Lambda} is the fully-qualified name of the one class that declared
     * the lambda</b>, and that part does not vary. So a rule of {@code com.example.Foo$$Lambda} is
     * scoped to exactly the lambdas written inside {@code Foo} - no wider. It is less precise than a
     * named class only in one specific way: a class declaring several <i>scheduler-bound</i> lambdas
     * cannot distinguish between them, so a rule of this shape asserts that every scheduler-bound
     * lambda in that class is safe under the same strategy. That is a claim about the real source of
     * one exact jar, and the evidence next to each entry in {@link #RULES} has to make it explicitly
     * - it is not weaker research, it is research over a slightly larger unit.
     *
     * <p>The character check after the prefix is what stops this being a plain {@code startsWith}:
     * {@code $$} is legal in a Java identifier, so a source-level class literally called
     * {@code FooBar} would otherwise be matched by a rule for {@code Foo}, and a hand-written class
     * called {@code Foo$$LambdaHelper} by a rule for {@code Foo$$Lambda}. Only the JVM's own two
